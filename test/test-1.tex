\section*{Question 1 (25 pts.)}

An experiment results in the following 5 observations: 10.0, 11.5, 10.8,  8.4,  9.8

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate the sample mean, $\bar{y}$.
	\item Calculate the sample variance, $s^2$.
	\item Calculate the sample standard deviation, $s$.
	\item Assuming the data are bell-shaped, determine an interval containing approximately 95\% of the data.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2 (25 pts.)}

If we wish to expand $(x + y)^5$, what is the coefficient of $x^3y^2$?

\newpage

\section*{Question 3 (25 pts.)}

A business office orders paper supplies from one of three vendors: $V_1$, $V_2$, or $V_3$. Orders are to be placed on two successive days, one order per day. Thus, $(V_2, V_3)$ might denote that vendor $V_2$ gets the order on the first day and vendor $V_3$ gets the order on the second day.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item List the sample points in this experiment of ordering paper on two successive days.
	\item Assume the vendors are selected at random each day and assign a probability to each sample point.
	\item Let $A$ denote the event that the same vendor gets both orders and $B$ the event that $V_2$ gets at least one order. Find $P(A)$, $P(B)$, $P(A \cup B)$, and $P(A \cap B)$ by summing the probabilities of the sample points in these events.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section*{Question 4 (25 pts.)}

A manufacturer has nine motors in stock, two of which are defective. The manufacturer receives three separate orders for three engines per order. If the engines are randomly assigned to each order, what is the probability that all three defective engines are assigned to the first order?

\newpage

\section*{Bonus 1  (10 pts.)}

You were given 8 potential test questions and were told that 4 of them would be on the exam. If you randomly chose 4 (and only 4) questions to solve before test day, what is the probability that these 4 would make up the exam?

\vfill

\section*{Bonus 2 (5 pts.)}

Refer to Question 4. What is the probability of both defective engines going to the same order (not necessarily the first order)?
